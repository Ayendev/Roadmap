# Changelog Component - AYENDEV

In this project I created a simple component for a website that displays a changelog. 
A changelog is a log or record of all notable changes made to a project or software. 
It is often used to keep users informed about the latest updates and improvements.

The goal of this project is to learn about positioning and layout in CSS. 
I created a simple HTML structure and used CSS to style it into a visually appealing and responsive changelog component.
