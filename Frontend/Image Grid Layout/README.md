# Image Grid Layout - AYENDEV

In this project, I've created a grid layout using HTML and CSS. The primary focus of this project is to help me learn and practice the CSS Grid layout technique, which is essential for creating responsive and flexible web layouts.

The goal of this project is to give me hands-on experience with CSS Grid, allowing you to create complex layouts with ease.
