# PORTOFOLIO - AYENDEV

The goal of this project is to style a website using CSS. 
I took the structure from the previous HTML-only project and apply various CSS techniques to enhance its appearance and responsiveness.

In this project, you are required to create a simple HTML only website with multiple pages.
The website should have following pages:

- Homepage
- Projects
